#University Management System


##For this project I built a program loop, an interactive command line for the TUM Board to be able to meet the following
 operations:

###Faculty operations:
1. Create and assign a student to a faculty.
2. Graduate a student from a faculty.
3. Display current enrolled students (Graduates would be ignored).
4. Display graduates (Currently enrolled students would be ignored).
5. Tell or not if a student belongs to this faculty.
   â€¢ General operations:
1. Create a new faculty.
2. Search what faculty a student belongs to by a unique identifier (for example by email
   or a unique ID).
3. Display University faculties.
4. Display all faculties belonging to a field. (Ex. FOOD_TECHNOLOGY)
