# This repository is a mirror of my work at Object Oriented Classes, Autumn 2023.


## Laboratory work number 1:

### Creating my first ever class in java!

 
## Laboratory work number 2:
### In this files, I tried my best to create an University Management System

## For this project I built a program loop, an interactive command line for the TUM Board to be able to meet the following faculty operations:

### Create and assign a student to a faculty; 
### Graduate a student from a faculty;
### Display current enrolled students (Graduates would be ignored);
### Display graduates (Currently enrolled students would be ignored);
### Tell or not if a student belongs to this faculty. 
## â€¢ General operations:
### Create a new faculty;
### Search what faculty a student belongs to by a unique identifier (for example by email or a unique ID);
### Display University faculties;
### Display all faculties belonging to a field. (Ex. FOOD_TECHNOLOGY);
